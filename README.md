The rental bike system, prevalent in many global cities, offers benefits such as reduced emissions, exercise for users, and low costs. 
In Seoul, South Korea, the system is popular due to demand for supplementary transport and expanded bike routes. Despite its popularity, 
Seoul's bike system faced financial losses, prompting the city government to plan bike advertisements. To analyze and optimize the system, SeoulBikeData (8,760 instances, 14 variables) 
from December 2017-November 2018 is used. Previous studies identified climate factors' influence on bike rentals. This paper explores predictive variables for bike demand and identifies 
the best model in regression. Additionally, it analyzes the relationship between variables (e.g., hour of the day) and subway congestion using classification methods with data until 
April 2023. The paper aims to find the best models for bike demand prediction and to understand subway congestion patterns for potential system enhancements (which might be used
in the future to predict additional rental bike allocation or bike advertisement-related factors like pricing/placement).
